## Installation

### 00. Before you start
If you have to use Slack for work and already have it installed, you're all set. If not, honestly, you're probably better off.

### 01. Open Slack theme settings

Go to **Settings > Appearance > Import Theme**

### 02. Paste theme code

**For yellow variant:**
```
#030408,#17181c,#fdf400,#e3e3e3,#17181c,#e3e3e3,#fdf400,#fdf400,#17181c,#e3e3e3
```

**For red variant:**
```
#030408,#17181c,#f22613,#e3e3e3,#17181c,#e3e3e3,#f22613,#f22613,#17181c,#e3e3e3
```

## Notes
- This theme format is for Slack's classic theme builder (10 colors).
- It will still work even if Slack only asks for 4 colors - just paste the whole string.
- Theme settings are workspace-dependent, so you'll need to apply this to each workspace separately.
