## Installation

### 00. Before you start
- Make sure Homebrew is installed ([install here](https://brew.sh))

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

### 01. Install Raycast
```sh
brew install --cask raycast
```

### 02. Manual theme configuration

Open Raycast Settings → General → Open Theme Studio, then manually configure the colors using the values from:

**For yellow variant:** [ambitopia-yellow.json](ambitopia-yellow.json)

**For red variant:** [ambitopia-red.json](ambitopia-red.json)

### 03. Save the theme

### 04. Leave the Theme Studio and select your new theme from the dropdown

## Notes

You must have a paid subscription to use Raycast's Theme Studio. I created these on a 2-week trial and may not keep it active due to the limitations. Raycast's theming system provides 12 color values, but will automatically adjust them if it considers them "off brand". The included JSON files are provided for reference only, as Raycast offers no import functionality. This barely qualifies as a theme, but I included it here for anyone who wants to use it.
