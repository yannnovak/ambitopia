# Raycast

Raycast's theming system provides 12 color values, but will automatically adjust them if it considers them "off brand", I almost did not include it because of this. I created these on a 2-week trial because you must have a paid subscription to use Raycast's Theme Studio and I already canceled because I was just not happy with the results enough to continue to pay.
