# Kagi

You may have noticed that privacy is a thread running through the apps I chose to include, and that extends to my search engine. Kagi is by far my favorite. So I was super excited to discover I could theme Kagi. Because I could include custom fonts, that inspired me to add custom fonts in a number of my themes across Ambitopia.

> [!NOTE]
> Kagi is a subscription service, so you will need to be a subscriber to use custom themes.
> This theme is based on [Purple Minimalist Theme](https://gist.github.com/andylunsford/1680b74b0bb1896694047c74470f396f) by Andy Lunsford. Since this was my first Kagi theme, I found it easier to start with one that had similar goals: not too much styling, but heavy on color palette changes.
