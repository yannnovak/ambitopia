# Standard Notes

Standard Notes was the most important theme in Ambitopia because I spend so much time using it, so I spent the most time on it. That said, I still need to get its syntax highlighting inline with the rest of the system, but it's close.

**Version \[Yellow\]:** 1.0.9  
**Version \[Red\]:** 1.0.2
