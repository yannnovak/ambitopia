# Vivaldi

This is where Ambitopia started. I used Safari as my default browser for years but kept a Chromium browser for testing. When liquid glass was introduced, I knew I'd need to leave Safari, so I consolidated to one Chromium browser. For privacy reasons I avoid Chrome, and I avoid Brave because of who funds it, so Vivaldi felt like a happy medium. After the switch, I had a ton of fun with its transformative theme options—once I had it just right, I started looking for ways to extend the aesthetic to other apps.
